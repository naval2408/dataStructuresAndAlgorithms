RAIN WATER HARVESTING
Apoorvaa has created an elevated roof. She wants to know how much water can she save during rain.

Given n non negative integers representing the elevation map where width of every bar is 1, Find the maximum water that she can save.

Explanation for the Sample input Testcase:
Elevation Map

So the total units of water she can save is 5 units

number_of_elements = int(input())
elements = input()
elementList = list(elements.split())
elevation = [int (i) for i in elementList]
leftMax = list()
rightMax = list()
#rightMax = [None] * (number_of_elements)
currentMax = elevation[0]
for i in range(len(elevation)):
    if elevation[i] >= currentMax :
        currentMax = elevation[i]
    leftMax.append(currentMax)
currentMax = elevation[number_of_elements-1]
for i in range(number_of_elements-1,-1,-1):

    if elevation[i] >= currentMax :
        currentMax = elevation[i]
    rightMax.append(currentMax)
rightMax.reverse()

total_water_conserved = 0

for i in range (0,number_of_elements):
    adjacentMin = min(rightMax[i],leftMax[i])
    total_water_conserved = total_water_conserved+adjacentMin-elevation[i]
print(total_water_conserved)
