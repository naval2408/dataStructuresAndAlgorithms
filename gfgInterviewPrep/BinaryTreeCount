Given a binary tree, count number of nodes in it. For example, count of nodes in below tree is 4.

        1
     /      \
   10      39
  /
5
Your task is to complete the function getSize() which accepts root node of the tree, and returns the size.


# Your task to complete this function
# function should return size of the binary tree as integer
def size(node):
    if node is None :
        return 0
    return (size(node.left)+size(node.right)+1)
