The task is to complete insert() function which is used to implement Insertion Sort.

Input:
First line of the input denotes number of test cases T. First line of the testcase is the size of array N and second line consists of array elements separated by space.

Output:
Sorted array in increasing order is displayed to the user.

User Task:
Since this is a functional problem you don'ta have to worry about input, you just have to complete the function insert().

Constraints:
1 <=T<= 50
1 <=N<= 1000
1 <=arr[i]<= 1000

Example:
Input:
2
5
4 1 3 9 7
10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

Output:
1 3 4 7 9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10


''' Please note that it's Function problem i.e.
you need to write your solution in the form of Function(s) only.
Driver Code to call/invoke your function is mentioned above. '''
