Given the first 2 terms A and B of an Arithmetic Series, tell the Nth term of the series. 

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer, the number of test cases T. T testcases follow. Each testcase in its first line should contain two positive integer A and B(First 2 terms of AP). In the second line of every testcase it contains of an integer N.

Output:
For each testcase, in a new line, print the Nth term of the Arithmetic Progression.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
-103 <= A <= 103
-103 <= B <= 103
1 <= N <= 104

Example:
Input:
2
2 3
4
1 2
10

Output:
5
10
